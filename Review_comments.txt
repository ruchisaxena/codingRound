Review Comments :
 1. All the common methods shoud get access from one place thats why i have created Base class for that (Re-usability).
 2. Implemented Page Object Model(POM) , EX: Every screen we have created page class for all the locators and actions realted to that particular screen.
 3. Created util package for utility methods.
 4. Added apache poi for fetching data from Excel file.
 5. WebDriver initialization moved to setDriverPath() because execution wil start from @BeforeMethod annotataion.
 6. for signIn functionality we have to have frame.
 
 
 Recommandation :
  
  1. Instead of waitFor() method we should use implict/explict wait because Thread waits for mentioned time even though element is already visible or not yet visible.
  2. Given code in FlightBookingTEst.java :
     
	  List<WebElement> originOptions = driver.findElement(By.id("ui-id-1")).findElements(By.tagName("li"));
        originOptions.get(0).click();
		
	Instead of passing index value to click we should use following code :
     
        List<WebElement> originOptions = driver.findElement(By.id("ui-id-1")).findElements(By.tagName("li"));        
        String locationName = "";
        for(int i=0;i<originOptions.size();i++) {
        	String text = originOptions.get(i).getText();
        	if(text.equalsIgnoreCase(locationName)) {
        		originOptions.get(i).click();
        	}
        }	 
 
 
 Concern :
   
          As i was fully occupied with some personal work this weekend i am not able to finish FlightBookingTEst scenario.
